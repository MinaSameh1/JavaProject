<strong>This was a Java project that we tried to make but failed</strong>

Long Story short, this was required of us in certain time frame, we didn't finish it sadly but we learned a lot, it was supposed to be a clinic manager, it ran on JDK 14 and javaFX 11.02, and used SQL Server for database

now the project is dead (as we lack any motivation to finish it D:) but i am relasing it incase it can help someone learn something.
